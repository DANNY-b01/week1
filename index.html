            <h2>protein</h2>
            
            <p>Protein is a macronutrient. It is one of the three nutrients found in food that the body needs in large amounts.It is essential for the maintenances and building of body tissues and muscle. Proteins are made of small compounds called amino acids the are lot of protenious food such as chicken,egg,etc.. Proteins are large biomolecules and macromolecules that comprise one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli. providing structure to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines its activity.

                A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. archaeaâ€”pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Some proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.
                
                Once formed, proteins only exist for a certain period and are then degraded and recycled by the cell's machinery through the process of protein turnover.</p>

    <h2>vitamin</h2>
    <p>Vitamins are complex organic substances found in our food that support almost every system in the body, including the immune system, the brain, and the nervous system. Many of them help convert food into energy and help the body to use carbohydrates, fat, and protein.they are also mostly found in fruits e.g orange,apple etc.Vitamins are traditionally categorized into two groups: water-soluble or fat-soluble. Whether vitamins are water-soluble or fat-soluble can affect their functions and sites of action.Vitamins and minerals ; animal fats; functions.

        Similar to minerals, vitamins cannot be synthesized by our body. Therefore, we need to get them from the food we consume or in extreme cases supplements to keep ourselves healthy The human body is so designed that it takes what it needs from the food we eat and then it passes out waste as excreta.

        These organic substances are abundantly found in both plants and animals source and play a vital role in both growth and development and optimal health.
        
        Listed below are the different types of vitamins along with their sources.</p>

        <p>minerals are inorganic substances required by the human body to function correctly. The human body requires varying amounts of minerals daily in order to build strong bones and muscles. It also helps to maintain various bodily functions.From the above definition, we can deduce that minerals are inorganic substances required by the human body to function correctly.

Therefore, we obtain these nutrients from eating foods rich in minerals.Minerals are one of the four groups of essential nutrients, the others of which are vitamins, essential fatty acids, and essential amino acids.

            When the body does not receive enough minerals, certain nutritional deficiency diseases may arise. Goitre, Osteoporosis, Anaemia, Hypomagnesaemia, and Diarrhoea are a few examples of mineral deficiency diseases.Some minerals are essential to your health. .
